We work on the development and application of efficient statistical learning methods and computational tools
for the analysis of large livestock data. The lab research program centers on combining on‑farm sensor data and
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for animal monitoring. The general goal is to create decision‑making
tools that will support efficient management decisions. Additionally, we employ high‑throughput
phenotyping alongside modern molecular technologies to investigate the genetic basis of novel and
hard‑to‑measure traits. Our lab mission is to harness top‑notch technologies to improve animal production,
reproduction, welfare and health, ultimately supporting efficient and sustainable livestock farming.
